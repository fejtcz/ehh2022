# Problem

Many hospitals around the world are addressing the underlying problem. There is a lot of activities, that are still manual and require significant effort from hospital staff. These activities include, for example, regular blood sugar readings. This time could certainly be used more efficiently and allow staff to work in a more pleasant environment.

# Solution

We offer a system that is ready for communication through the api of individual suppliers of closed solutions as well as our own HW that can communicate with Dexcom sensors directly via BlueTooth. A big benefit is the ability to read data in parallel alongside the patient's client application. Our application can easily pair users, visualize waveforms, raise alarms and analyze the data retrospectively.

# Impact 

Simplification of repetitive tasks. Working in a less stressful environment. Data collection for subsequent analysis and the ability to look for anomalies in the patient's condition. It's cheap and easy to implement into existing systems. Better overwiev of patients health and automatic alerting based on real time readings increasing safety

# Feasibility & financials

At the hackathon we tested the possibility of independent reading of glucose meters with the help of third-party api, as well as direct wireless reading with our own hardware from the sensors. Therefore, we believe that we are able to design and deliver simple and cheap hardware in the tens of euros, which will ultimately save the customer considerable costs.

# What is new about your solution?

We have used standard formats and protocols such as RestAPI, MQTT, which makes it easy for interacting with existing systems. You can visualize data in your intern systems or use connections for training neural networks for possible future predictions of severe or critical conditions. Our solution is independent of Dexcom cloud services, which can be possible "bottleneck" as unknown third party SW. The hospital can decide, where the patients data will be securely stored.
